# Fork Notes:
I have only updated the Core and Share SDKs (for both Android and iOS), and only tested basic app event tracking and sharing functionality.

Feel free to open PRs to expand the functionality or fix any issues.

# Xamarin Components for Facebook

Xamarin creates and maintains Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS bindings for Facebook SDKs.

## Building 

### Prerequisites

Before building the libraries and samples in this repository, you will need to install [.NET Core][30] and the [Cake .NET Core Tool][32]:

```sh
dotnet tool install -g cake.tool
```

When building on macOS, you may also need to install [CocoaPods][31]:

```sh
# Homebrew
brew install cocoapods

# Ruby Gems
gem install cocoapods
```

### Compiling

You can either build all the libraries and samples in the repository from the root:

```sh
dotnet cake
```

Or, you can build each component separately:

```sh
# iOS
cd Facebook.iOS
dotnet cake

# Android
cd Facebook.Android
dotnet cake
```

The following targets can be specified using the `--target=<target-name>`:

 - `libs` builds the class library bindings (depends on `externals`)
 - `externals` downloads and builds the external dependencies
 - `samples` builds all of the samples (depends on `libs`)
 - `nuget` builds the nuget packages (depends on `libs`)
 - `clean` cleans up everything


### Working in Visual Studio

Before the `.sln` files will compile in the IDEs, the external dependencies need to be downloaded. This can be done by running the `externals` target:

```sh
dotnet cake --target=externals
```

After the externals are downloaded and built, the `.sln` files should compile in your IDE.
